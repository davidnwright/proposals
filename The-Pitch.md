Plastic Pedagogies: Design Thinking and Prototyping as Classroom Practice

Session Rubric: Mapping / Building / Playing

Break the session into 3 parts, 25 minutes each, leaving 15 minutes for questions at the end.

**Section 1: Mapping - 25 minutes**

WE NEED:
- PHOTOCOPIES OF LONDON / NYC TUBE / SUBWAY MAP
- BLUE & RED & GREEN FELT PENS (Sharpie size)

We begin the session by suggesting that design thinking in the classroom can be defined as being able to trace routes, represent expectations and assumptions by mapping out goals or, finding alternative paths / representations that we did not see / expect in the first instance.

The idea here is to figure out what we want by mapping some paths and seeing how our constructions of those paths might inform our encounters. We also want to see how the imposition of rules, whether by our own expectations or by the will of others will affect the desired outcomes or reveal how alternative paths are necessary. 

**Activity I, in groups of ??:**

- **Task:**
	- **Using a blue pen:** Chart a way through the map to any one "tourist" destination using whatever method you like (use internet to identify routes, the attraction, etc.).
	- **Using a red pen:** Chart a way through the map to a different "tourist" destination using only the information you have at hand and imagining yourself as someone who cannot speak English (no using the internet, no reading beyond phonic nonsense--you may use yr own knowledge of the locale)
	- **Using a green pen:** Chart a way through the map to "any" destination you thinking is interesting using one of the above parameters (but not both).
- **Emerging Questions:**
	- How was your initial destination discussed and decide upon? What political machinations occurred in your group (ie: who took charge and why)? How might this exercise be helpful in the classroom?
	- How did the destination shift when the second parameter was added? Did it shift? Why? Why not? How might this exercise be helpful in the classroom?
	- What was the outcome of the Third parameter? How might this exercise be useful in the classroom?
	- What does the map look like entirely? What does this suggest about the complexity of your thinking or the representation of that thinking?
	- Anyone build in an alternate subway line? Why / Why not? 

**Activity II, in groups of ??:**

- **Task:** Conceptualize a board game that represents your expectations for this session (past, present, or future).
-  **Instructions:** The board game must have a set of rules that set out the following:
	- How does the game resolve? (Note: this doesn't necessarily mean winning or losing, but ending.)
	- How do you move or change direction? (ie: wrong answer means move back? learn something new means move forward? How many spaces (what is the measure of success?)
	- And, the game instructions must explain why does the board look like it does? 
- **Emerging Questions:** 
	- So why does the board look like it does? How does this inform how you are approaching the workshop (what set ideologies / outcomes / perspectives / topics / expectations are already in this room?
	- What is the nature of the game's resolution? Why might this be important when we think about open classroom practice?
	- What political actions are implicated in the movements of the game? What expectations, ideologies, AUDIENCES, are embedded in those movements or the forces that enact the movements?

**Section 2: Prototyping** - 25 minutes**

WE NEED:
- HANDOUTS OF AIRLINE SEATBACK INFORMATION SHEET

In this section, we are thinking about how prototyping serves to provide insight into how systems operate (and we might think of an essay as a system for rhetorical argument / a Math equation as a system for representing objects and their numbers, etc.) by making / exploring working systems and dreaming up new prototypes.

The idea here is to move away from the theoretical discussion into a deployment of the system itself. Take home exercise example here would be making students build a paper airplane then asking them to pass them around and then asking them to write the instructions for building one the one the hold in their hands (not the one they built). Then, pass the instructions around and see how closely they resemble the prototype. 

What we want to put forward in the classroom is a process where students can evaluate their own systems of learning, their own systems for formal writing / tests, in order build a better formal presentation of the product. 

In this instance, we are also thinking about prototyping as a form of repair, not to invention. The goal is to prototype improvements to convention not simply invent workarounds. 

----

**Activity III, in groups of ??:**

- **Task:**
	- Reduce the number of frame sequences in the seat-back information sheet to three (for ONE of the actions).
- **Instructions:**
	- Most of the instructions feature a sequence of between 5 and 9 frames to convey the actions needed to survive in an airline event. Try to pair things down so that there are only three frames per sequence. You can fill the frames as much as you like. Be daring, follow your heart. 
- **Emerging Questions:**
	- What assumptions are embedded in the original sequences that emerged when they were edited? How might this be useful practice for a classroom? (Anyone in Math? English? Where we tend to start with ideals).
	- Did you invent, or edit? Why?
	- What assumptions about the audience / comprehension-level / critical thinking skills did your group bring to this activity? Were those recognizable in the original instance?

**Activity IV, in groups of ??:**

- **Task:** 
	- Apply the outcomes from the above activity to create a 3 sequence direction for being successful in your classroom or in your role at the institution (a training card per se).
- **Emerging Questions:**
	- How did audience frame what you were building?
	- How many of the sequences actually correspond to general concerns rather than your specific concerns (in other words, how much do I need to know about Higher Ed to interpret the meaning behind the sequence?)
	- How does your inability to or confidence in drawing, illustrating inform how you complete this task? Is there any "equality"? 
	- Who got left out? Who won't understand your icons? Why?

**Section 3: Playing - 25 minutes**

WE NEED
- ENERGY TO SEE THIS THROUGH

When we bring technological tools to bear on the practices illustrated above, we might be able to stretch things. Play is different than a game. Play has no formal rules, is open to all (usually outside linguistic, racial, gendered boundaries), has no beginning or end beyond the impetus of the individuals in the sandbox. Play can also be extended to other forms of life--animals, birds, trees all might be called "playful" as we engage with them.

Activity 5 - segueying from the above, make a GIF that represents three technological barriers to learning for students.
- do those GIFs represent something different from your classroom or institutional strategy?

Activity 6 - make a facebook profile of your most frustrated student...
- what does this profile tell us about our classroom-based practice?

Activity 7 - how do we tell the difference between being open as in sharing stuff about oneself and open as in exchangeable and reusable.






- Gaming
- Designing
- Profiling - taking characters somewhere students go to every day - how would characters, social situations, locations,  
- Giffing

We all know hands-on learning is a great way to teach, but where do we start making smart use of emerging technology? We’re going to show you how to get students thinking about concepts in more complicated ways than a five-paragraph essay allows and encourage you to reflect on how you teach and how students learn.

Desktop fabrication and participatory web culture offer different models for exploring and understanding how we teach. Thinking about the methodologies of design thinking--iteration, prototyping, modeling--this session will explore how classrooms can be re-envisioned as a space for both creative and intellectual application. 

Exploring several venues for creating innovative classroom learning modules, from websites, to fabrication, to fast prototyping, we’ll look at how we might expand our approach to teaching critical thinking skills (in the humanities). For instance, we’ll explore how objects can enliven discussions about themes and theoretical concepts such as narrative, frustration, and access. At the same time, we’ll look at how making objects using the emerging fabrication technologies encourages a reflective practice that enlightens our understanding of both teaching and the experience of our students.

Some of the “why didn’t I think of that?!” ideas we’ll cover in this session include:
Break a text or assignment or intentionally distort it
Build a website / facebook profile for a character in a novel
Fabricate an object that represents a concept
Design a board game that reflects the plot of a novel or the experience of learning
Draw a comic that represents different disciplinary analytical practices
Make animated gifs or gif posts to use as course evaluations or journals

Origins of Design Thinking: Peter Rowe's 1987 book Design Thinking, which described methods and approaches used by architects and urban planners, was a significant early usage of the term in the design research literature. Rolf Faste expanded things to conceptualize "design thinking as a method of creative action."

Design thinking is a formal method for practical, creative resolution of problems and creation of solutions, with the intent of an improved future result. It is a form of solution-based, or solution-focused thinking--starting with a goal (a better future situation) instead of solving a specific problem. By considering both present and future conditions and parameters of the problem, alternative solutions may be explored simultaneously. 

The approach differs from the analytical scientific method, which begins by thoroughly defining all parameters of a problem to create a solution. Design thinking identifies and investigates with known and ambiguous aspects of the current situation to discover hidden parameters and open alternative paths that may lead to the goal. Because design thinking is iterative, intermediate "solutions" are also potential starting points of alternative paths, including redefining of the initial problem.

The terms analysis and synthesis come from (classical) Greek and mean literally "to loosen up" and "to put together" respectively. In general, analysis is defined as the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts or components. Synthesis is defined as the opposite procedure: to combine separate elements or components in order to form a coherent whole. However, analysis and synthesis, as scientific methods, always go hand in hand; they complement one another. Every synthesis is built upon the results of a preceding analysis, and every analysis requires a subsequent synthesis in order to verify and correct its results.

Divergent thinking versus convergent thinking
Design thinking employs divergent thinking as a way to ensure that many possible solutions are explored in the first instance, and then convergent thinking as a way to narrow these down to a final solution. Divergent thinking is the ability to offer different, unique or variant ideas adherent to one theme while convergent thinking is the ability to find the "correct" solution to the given problem. Design thinking encourages divergent thinking to ideate many solutions (possible or impossible) and then uses convergent thinking to prefer and realize the best resolution.

Design thinking as a process for problem-solving
Unlike analytical thinking, design thinking includes "building up" ideas, with few, or no, limits on breadth during a "brainstorming" phase.[13] This helps reduce fear of failure in the participant(s) and encourages input and participation from a wide variety of sources in the ideation phases. The phrase "thinking outside the box" has been coined to describe one goal of the brainstorming phase and is encouraged, since this can aid in the discovery of hidden elements and ambiguities in the situation and discovering potentially faulty assumptions.

One version of the design thinking process has seven stages: define, research, ideate, prototype, choose, implement, and learn. Within these seven steps, problems can be framed, the right questions can be asked, more ideas can be created, and the best answers can be chosen. The steps aren't linear; can occur simultaneously and be repeated. A simpler expression of the process is Robert McKim's phrase "Express–Test–Cycle." An alternative five-phase description of the process is described by Christoph Meinel and Larry Leifer: (re)defining the problem, needfinding and benchmarking, ideating, building, testing. Yet another way to look at it is Shewart's "Plan-Do-Study-Act" PDSA cycle.

Although design is always influenced by individual preferences, the design thinking method shares a common set of traits, mainly: creativity, ambidextrous thinking, teamwork, user-centeredness (empathy), curiosity and optimism.

The path through these process steps is not strictly circular. Meinel and Leifer state: "While the stages are simple enough, the adaptive expertise required to choose the right inflection points and appropriate next stage is a high order intellectual activity that requires practice and is learnable."

Attributes of design thinking[edit]
Principles[edit]
Christoph Meinel and Larry Leifer assert that there are four principles to design thinking:[14]

The human rule – all design activity is ultimately social in nature
The ambiguity rule – design thinkers must preserve ambiguity
The re-design rule – all design is re-design
The tangibility rule – making ideas tangible always facilitates communication

Wicked problems
Design thinking is especially useful when addressing what Horst Rittel referred to as wicked problems, which are ill-defined or tricky (as opposed to wicked in the sense of malicious).[15] With ill-defined problems, both the problem and the solution are unknown at the outset of the problem-solving exercise. This is as opposed to "tame" or "well-defined" problems where the problem is clear, and the solution is available through some technical knowledge.[16]

For wicked problems, the general thrust of the problem may be clear, however considerable time and effort is spent in order to clarify the requirements. A large part of the problem solving activity, then, consists of problem definition and problem shaping.

The "a-ha moment"
The "a-ha moment" is the moment where there is suddenly a clear forward path.[18] It is the point in the cycle where synthesis and divergent thinking, analysis and convergent thinking, and the nature of the problem all come together and an appropriate resolution has been captured. Prior to this point, the process may seem nebulous, hazy and inexact. At this point, the path forward is so obvious that in retrospect it seems odd that it took so long to recognize it. After this point, the focus becomes more and more clear as the final product is constructed.[19]

Methods and process
Design methods and design process are often used interchangeably, but there are significant differences between the two.

Design methods are techniques, rules, or ways of doing things that someone uses within a design discipline. Methods for design thinking include interviewing, creating user profiles, looking at other existing solutions, creating prototypes, mind mapping, asking questions like the five whys, and situational analysis.

Because of design thinking's parallel nature, there are many different paths through the phases. This is part of the reason design thinking may seem to be "fuzzy" or "ambiguous" when compared to more analytical, Cartesian methods of science and engineering.

Some early design processes stemmed from soft systems methodology in the 1960s. Koberg and Bagnall wrote The All New Universal Traveller in 1972 and presented a circular, seven-step process to problem-solving. These seven steps could be done lineally or in feed-back loops.[20] Stanford's d.school developed an updated seven step process in 2007.[21] Other expressions of design processes have been proposed, including a three-step simplified triangular process (or the six-part, less simplified pyramid) by Bryan Lawson.[11] Hugh Dubberly's free e-book How Do You Design: A Compendium of Models summarizes a large number of design process models.[22]

Design thinking calls for considering the given user case from various perspectives, empathizing with users, and addressing various stakeholders.[citation needed]

The use of visual analogy in design thinking and learning:

Ill-defined problems often contain higher-order and obscure relationships. Design thinking can address these through the use of analogies. An understanding of the expected results, or lack of domain-related knowledge for the task, may be developed by correlating different internal representations, such as images, to develop an understanding of the obscure or ill-defined elements of the situation. The process involves several complex cognitive mechanisms, as the design task often has elements in multiple cognitive domains—visual, mathematical, auditory or tactile—requiring the usage of multiple "languages", like visual thinking.

Differences from science and humanities
Although many design fields have been categorized as lying between Science and the Arts and Humanities, design may be seen as its own distinct way of understanding the world, based on solution-based problem solving, problem shaping, synthesis, and appropriateness in the built environment.

One of the first design science theorists, John Chris Jones, postulated that design was different than the arts, sciences and mathematics in the 1970s. In response to the question "Is designing an art, a science or a form of mathematics?" Jones responded:

The main point of difference is that of timing. Both artists and scientists operate on the physical world as it exists in the present (whether it is real or symbolic), while mathematicians operate on abstract relationships that are independent of historical time. Designers, on the other hand, are forever bound to treat as real that which exists only in an imagined future and have to specify ways in which the foreseen thing can be made to exist.

— John Chris Jones, Design Method[23]
Design can be seen as its own culture in education, with its own methods and ways of thinking, which can be systematically taught in both K-12 and higher education. Nigel Cross set out to show the differences between the humanities, the sciences, and design in his paper "Designerly Ways of Knowing". He observed that:[10]

The phenomenon of study in each culture is
in the sciences: the natural world
in the humanities: human experience
in design: the artificial world
The appropriate methods in each culture are
in the sciences: controlled experiment, classification, analysis
in the humanities: analogy, metaphor, evaluation
in design: modeling, pattern-forming, synthesis
The values of each culture are
in the sciences: objectivity, rationality, neutrality, and a concern for "truth"
in the humanities: subjectivity, imagination, commitment, and a concern for "justice"
in design: practicality, ingenuity, empathy , and a concern for "appropriateness"
The languages of design[edit]
Conventionally, designers communicate mostly in visual or object languages.[10][24] Symbols, signs, and metaphors are used through the medium of sketching, diagrams and technical drawings to translate abstract requirements into concrete objects. The way designers communicate, then, is through understanding this way of coding design requirements in order to produce built products.[25]

Design thinking in business[edit]
Design thinking has two common interpretations in the business world:[citation needed]

Designers bringing their methods into business by either taking part themselves in business process, or training business people to use design methods
Designers achieving innovative outputs or products (for example, the iPod)
The first interpretation has been described by Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO, at a TED lecture,[26] though his blog[27] also considers the second interpretation.

The limits of the first kind of design thinking in business are also being explored. Not all problems yield to design thinking alone, where it may be a "temporary fix".[28] Design thinking companies including IDEO and Sense Worldwide are responding to this by building business thinking capabilities.[29]

Tim Brown has argued that design thinking is now widely, but sporadically, used in business. He argues that competitive advantage comes from sustained use of design thinking, from becoming "masters of the art."[30]

In organization and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture/Design/Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm, which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an abductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics/Economics/Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm.[31]

Design thinking in education[edit]
Design thinking has been suggested for use in schools in a variety of curricular ways,[32][33][34] as well as for redesigning student spaces and school systems.[35]

Design thinking in education typically takes three forms: helping school administrators solve institution-based problems, aiding educators develop more creative lesson plans, and engendering design thinking skills in students.

There are currently many researchers exploring the intersection of design thinking and education.[36] The REDLab group, from Stanford University's Graduate School of Education, conducts research into design thinking in K-12, secondary, and post-secondary settings.[37] The Hasso Plattner Design Thinking Research Program is a collaborative program between Stanford University and the Hasso Plattner Institute from Potsdam, Germany.[36][38] The Hasso Plattner Design Thinking Research Program's mission is to "apply rigorous academic methods to understand how and why design thinking innovation works and fails."[38]

In addition to enriching curriculum and expanding student perspectives, design thinking can also benefit educators. Researchers have proposed that design thinking can enable educators to integrate technology into the classroom.[39]

Design thinking as a viable curricular and systemic reform program is increasingly being recognized by educators. "Much of today's education system guides students toward finding the correct answers to fill-in-the blanks on standardized tests, as this kind of instruction facilitates streamlined assessments to measure success or failure... It is critical that, particularly in under-served schools this model of learning does not continue to prevail. Students need both the skills and the tools to participate in a society where problems are increasingly complex and nuanced understandings are vital."[40]

Uses in K-12 education
In the K-12 arena, design thinking is employed to promote creative thinking, teamwork, and student responsibility for learning. The non profit Tools at Schools aims to expose students, educators, and schools to design thinking. The organization does this by facilitating a relationship between a school and a manufacturing company. Over a minimum of six months, representatives from the manufacturing company teach students the principles of design and establish the kind of product to be designed.[41] The students collaborate to design a prototype that the manufacturer produces.[41] Once the prototype arrives, the students must promote the product and support the ideas that lead to its design.[41]

An example of the Tools at Schools partnership is the redesign of school equipment by 8th grade students at The School at Columbia University. The students were divided into groups and asked to redesign a locker, chair, or a desk to better suit the needs of 21st century pupils.[42] The students' final products were displayed at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair where they demonstrated their product to fair attendees and industry professionals.[42] Overall Tools at Schools not only introduces students to the design process, it exposes them to the design profession through their interactions with designers and manufacturers.[42] Since the students work together in groups, design thinking in education also encourages collaborative learning.

Another organization that works with integrating design thinking for students is the corporation NoTosh. NoTosh has a Design Thinking School to teach instructors how to implement design thinking into their curriculum. One of the design thinking techniques NoTosh adopted from the corporate world and applied to education is hexagonal thinking. Hexagonal thinking consists of gathering cut-outs in hexagon shapes and writing a concept or fact on each one. Students then connect the hexagons by laying related ideas or facts together. The visual representation of relationships helps students better conceptualize wicked problems.[43] Another concrete example of design thinking in action is NoTosh's "Googleable vs NonGoogleable Questions" exercise.[43] Given a specific topic, students brainstorm questions on that issue and divide their questions into "Googleable and NonGoogleable."[43] Students research the Googleable questions and present their findings to the class while the NonGoogleable questions are used to create a project.[43]

Stanford University's Taking Design Thinking to Schools Initiative
Apart from non profit entities and corporations, research universities are also involved in deploying design thinking curriculum to K-12 schools. Part of Stanford University's efforts to incorporate design thinking in education into a hands-on setting is the Taking Design Thinking to Schools initiative. The Stanford School of Education and d.school partner with K-12 teachers in the Palo Alto area to discover ways to apply design thinking in an educational setting.[44] "Teachers and students engage in hands-on design challenges that focus on developing empathy, promoting a bias towards action, encouraging ideation, developing metacognitive awareness and fostering active problem solving."[44]

Taking Design Thinking to Schools identifies the following design thinking process:

Understand: students explore the topic through research and develop familiarity with the subject matter
Observe: this phase consists of students taking note of their environment, which includes physical surroundings and human interactions; students gather more information about peoples' actions and possible motivation through discussion
Point of view: students consider alternate points of views to better understand the problem and to inform their ideas in the next phase
Ideate: this phase consists of students brainstorming ideas without criticism or inhibition. In this phase, the focus is on generating lots of ideas with an emphasis on creativity and enjoying the process.
Prototype: in this phase students create quick prototypes to investigate ideas generated during the ideation phase
Test: students test their ideas in a repetitive fashion and determine which aspects of the design are effective and which could be improved.[44]
By employing this process, the Stanford team and Taking Design Thinking to Schools participants collaborate to develop coursework that students will find engrossing and "hands-on."[44] Thus, the program at Stanford combines both design thinking for teachers who must create alternative curriculum and students who must complete the design thinking-based projects.

The K12 Lab at Stanford
The K12 Lab network is a part of the Stanford University d.school and according to its website its mission is to "inspire and develop the creative confidence of educators and support edu innovators catalyzing new models for teaching and learning."[45] The K12 Lab Network publishes a wiki with information on creating design challenges for K-12 schools. The wiki provides tools for thinking about design challenges as well as criteria for implementing design challenges.[46]

The Design Thinking for Educators toolkit
The Design Thinking for Educators toolkit was developed in 2011 by the design firm IDEO in partnership with the PreK-12 independent school Riverdale Country School.[47] The Design Thinking for Educators toolkit that is currently offered to the public for free download is the second version.[48] The Design Thinking for Educators toolkit is a comprehensive resource for educators to use, which includes a "walk-through of the design thinking process complete with examples and a downloadable workbook".[49] The toolkit has been used in academic research to aid in the creation of an "iPad learning Ecosystem".[50] to help design a program to aid at-risk youth in the transition from elementary to secondary school,[50] as well as to redesign libraries.[49]

AIGA
AIGA has implemented a movement, DesignEd K12, to take designing thinking to schools. This movement is guided by volunteers and there is not a specific program to follow; instead volunteer designers introduce students to the design field and consequently, design thinking. DesignEd K12 intends to motivate students to use design thinking to solve problems; to create a network where designers, students, and educational professionals share best practices; to shape a recommended approach to teaching design; and to cultivate a passion for design among young people.[51] Across the nation, many of AIGA's chapters are working with school districts. The programs range in scope; some mentor students who have shown an interest in design, while other programs offer students the opportunity to explore design and participate in design thinking projects within scheduled classed or through an after-school activity.[51]

Uses in higher education
Design thinking is currently being taught in "workshops, supplemental training, courses, or degree programs" in over 60 universities and colleges.[52] Design thinking is used by colleges as a way to instruct students on the phases of design, and to help develop innovative solutions to existing problems.[52] The d.school at Stanford University is a well-known design thinking program in higher education, with students from Stanford's departments of engineering, medicine, business, law, and education utilizing the d.school to develop innovative solutions to problems.[53] The University of Kentucky also has formalized instruction on design thinking through its dLab. The dLab serves a multitude of functions from helping schools resolve their issues with design thinking to conducting empirical experiments on design thinking to collaborating with outside organizations to provide issues that plague their organization.[54] Radford University, located in Radford, Virginia, currently offers a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree in design thinking.[43] The MFA degree offered is a completely online degree that emphasizes design thinking, design history, design research, design management, and design doing.[55]

The Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School and the Maryland Institute College of Art began offering an MBA/MA in design leadership in 2012.[56] Students simultaneously earn a master of arts degree in design leadership from an art school as well as an MBA from a research institution.

Obstacles to implementing design thinking in schools
The accountability to succeed on high-stakes standardized tests in K-12 environments prevents the implementation of design thinking curriculum. Educators feel that focusing on classic curriculum will better prepare their students to perform well on these exams.[40] Resistance to design thinking also springs from concerns about the appropriateness of applying design thinking to an educational setting. It has been argued that design thinking is best applied by professionals who know a field well.[57] Therefore, K-12 students who are limited by their reduced understanding of both the field and their still developing intellectual capacities may not be best suited to design thinking activities.[57]

Another more subtle obstacle to design thinking in schools may come from members of the academic community who believe design thinking should remain in the milieu of avant-garde companies.[58] Other issues that may prevent the implementation of design thinking in scholastic settings may be a lack of awareness of the field, educators' uncertainty in implementing new approaches to teaching, and lack of institutional support.

Even for institutions that see the value of design thinking, there is the issue of implementing these new approaches to education successfully. Admittedly "creating an effective thinking and successful team learning experience is a sticky wicked problem."[52]

Design thinking in teaching and learning through ICT[edit]
The integration of ICT into teaching and learning presents many challenges that go beyond issues dealing with technical implementation. Some researchers have already claimed the limited effects of ICT adoption in learning;[59][60][61] Considering the emphasis and the investment that has been placed on the use of ICT in formal learning settings (schools and higher education institutions) it is important to identify where the problems are. In this regard, some voices of the educational community focus on the methods used for integrating ICT in teaching and learning;.[62][63] In this sense, the adoption of a design thinking mindset is regarded as a promising strategy to develop holistic solutions.

Design thinking in teaching and learning through ICT can be considered as similar activities. First, it's important to acknowledge that the type of problems faced by the educational community when adopting learning technology are unique, ill-defined and do not have clear solutions;.[64][65] This definition corresponds very well to the term wicked problems used by the design community.[66] Secondly, similarly to what happens in design, the diversity of actors brings another layer of complexity that should be recognized. In this regard, collaboration between different stakeholders during the design process is another key issue that could contribute to develop more meaningful technologies for learning;[62][63][67]

Design thinking has been outlined as a meaningful approach for facing wicked problems.[9] The adoption of a design mindset helps understand that there can be many solutions for a given situation and that any design requires testing. From this perspective, bringing design thinking to learning design and design expertise to the development process of technological learning solutions can contribute to the creation of more holistic solutions in learning through ICT.[68]

An array of prototypes leading to the final design.
A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.[1] It is a term used in a variety of contexts, including semantics, design, electronics, and software programming. A prototype is designed to test and try a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users. Prototyping serves to provide specifications for a real, working system rather than a theoretical one.[2] In some workflow models, creating a prototype (a process sometimes called materialization) is the step between the formalization and the evaluation of an idea.[3]

The word prototype derives from the Greek πρωτότυπον prototypon, "primitive form", neutral of πρωτότυπος prototypos, "original, primitive", from πρῶτος protos, "first" and τύπος typos, "impression".[1][4]

Basic prototype categories[edit]
Prototypes explore different aspects of an intended design:

A Proof-of-Principle Prototype explore some functional, but not all, aspects of the intended design.
A Form Study Prototype explore the size and appearance, but not the functionality, of the intended design.
A User Experience Prototype captures enough aspects of the intended design that it can support user research.
A Visual Prototype captures the size and appearance, but not the functionality, of the intended design.
A Functional Prototype captures both function and appearance of the intended design. It may be created in with a different method and scale from final design.[5][6]

In general, prototypes will differ from the final production variant in three fundamental ways:

Materials - Production materials may require manufacturing processes involving higher capital costs than what is practical for prototyping. Instead, engineers or prototyping specialists will attempt to substitute materials with properties that simulate the intended final material.
Processes - Often expensive and time-consuming unique tooling is required to fabricate a custom design. Prototypes will often compromise by using more variable processes, repeatable or controlled methods; substandard, inefficient, or substandard technology sources; or insufficient testing for technology maturity.
Lower fidelity - Final production designs often require extensive effort to capture high volume manufacturing detail. Such detail is generally unwarranted for prototypes as some refinement to the design is to be expected. Often prototypes are built using very limited engineering detail as compared to final production intent, which often uses statistical process controls and rigorous testing. An example of a lower fidelity or lo-fi prototyping technique is a paper prototype. These can be used as a tool for discussion. They are commonly used for early testing of a software design, and can be part of a software walkthrough to confirm design decisions before more costly levels of effort are expended.[7]

Engineers and prototyping specialists seek to understand the limitations of prototypes to exactly simulate the characteristics of their intended design.

It is important to realize that by their very definition, prototypes will represent some compromise from the final production design. Due to differences in materials, processes and design fidelity, it is possible that a prototype may fail to perform acceptably whereas the production design may have been sound. A counter-intuitive idea is that prototypes may actually perform acceptably whereas the production design may be flawed since prototyping materials and processes may occasionally outperform their production counterparts.

In general, it can be expected that individual prototype costs will be substantially greater than the final production costs due to inefficiencies in materials and processes. Prototypes are also used to revise the design for the purposes of reducing costs through optimization and refinement.

It is possible to use prototype testing to reduce the risk that a design may not perform as intended, however prototypes generally cannot eliminate all risk. There are pragmatic and practical limitations to the ability of a prototype to match the intended final performance of the product and some allowances and engineering judgement are often required before moving forward with a production design.

Building the full design is often expensive and can be time-consuming, especially when repeated several times—building the full design, figuring out what the problems are and how to solve them, then building another full design. As an alternative, rapid prototyping or rapid application development techniques are used for the initial prototypes, which implement part, but not all, of the complete design. This allows designers and manufacturers to rapidly and inexpensively test the parts of the design that are most likely to have problems, solve those problems, and then build the full design.

This counter-intuitive idea —that the quickest way to build something is, first to build something else— is shared by scaffolding and the telescope rule.

Engineering sciences[edit]
In technology research, a technology demonstrator is a prototype serving as proof-of-concept and demonstration model for a new technology or future product, proving its viability and illustrating conceivable applications.

In large development projects, a testbed is a platform and prototype development environment for rigorous experimentation and testing of new technologies, components, scientific theories and computational tools.

With recent advances in computer modeling it is becoming practical to eliminate the creation of a physical prototype (except possibly at greatly reduced scales for promotional purposes), instead modeling all aspects of the final product as a computer model. An example of such a development can be seen in Boeing 787 Dreamliner, in which the first full sized physical realization is made on the series production line. Computer modeling is now being extensively used in automotive design, both for form (in the styling and aerodynamics of the vehicle) and in function — especially for improving vehicle crashworthiness and in weight reduction to improve mileage.

Mechanical and electrical engineering[edit]
Main article: rapid prototyping
The most common use of the word prototype is a functional, although experimental, version of a non-military machine (e.g., automobiles, domestic appliances, consumer electronics) whose designers would like to have built by mass production means, as opposed to a mockup, which is an inert representation of a machine's appearance, often made of some non-durable substance.

An electronics designer often builds the first prototype from breadboard or stripboard or perfboard, typically using "DIP" packages.

However, more and more often the first functional prototype is built on a "prototype PCB" almost identical to the production PCB, as PCB manufacturing prices fall and as many components are not available in DIP packages, but only available in SMT packages optimized for placing on a PCB.

Builders of military machines and aviation prefer the terms "experimental" and "service test".

Electronics prototyping[edit]

In electronics, prototyping means building an actual circuit to a theoretical design to verify that it works, and to provide a physical platform for debugging it if it does not. The prototype is often constructed using techniques such as wire wrapping or using veroboard or breadboard, with the result being a circuit that is electrically identical to the design but not physically identical to the final product.

Open-source tools like Fritzing exist to document electronic prototypes (especially the breadboard-based ones) and move toward physical production. Prototyping platforms such as Arduino also simplify the task of programming and interacting with a microcontroller. The developer can choose to deploy their invention as-is using the prototyping platform, or replace it with only the microcontroller chip and the circuitry that is relevant to their product.

A technician can quickly build a prototype (and make additions and modifications) using these techniques, but for volume production it is much faster and usually cheaper to mass-produce custom printed circuit boards than to produce these other kinds of prototype boards. The proliferation of quick-turn PCB fabrication and assembly companies has enabled the concepts of rapid prototyping to be applied to electronic circuit design. It is now possible, even with the smallest passive components and largest fine-pitch packages, to have boards fabricated, assembled, and even tested in a matter of days.

Computer programming/computer science[edit]
Main articles: Software prototyping and Software release cycle
In many programming languages, a function prototype is the declaration of a subroutine or function (and should not be confused with software prototyping). This term is rather C/C++-specific; other terms for this notion are signature, type and interface. In prototype-based programming (a form of object-oriented programming), new objects are produced by cloning existing objects, which are called prototypes.[8]

The term may also refer to the Prototype Javascript Framework.

Additionally, the term may refer to the prototype design pattern.

Prototype software is often referred to as alpha grade, meaning it is the first version to run. Often only a few functions are implemented, the primary focus of the alpha is to have a functional base code on to which features may be added. Once alpha grade software has most of the required features integrated into it, it becomes beta software for testing of the entire software and to adjust the program to respond correctly during situations unforeseen during development.[9]

Often the end users may not be able to provide a complete set of application objectives, detailed input, processing, or output requirements in the initial stage. After the user evaluation, another prototype will be built based on feedback from users, and again the cycle returns to customer evaluation. The cycle starts by listening to the user, followed by building or revising a mock-up, and letting the user test the mock-up, then back. There is now a new generation of tools called Application Simulation Software which help quickly simulate application before their development.

Extreme programming uses iterative design to gradually add one feature at a time to the initial prototype.

Continuous learning approaches within organizations or businesses may also use the concept of business or process prototypes through software models.

Data prototyping[edit]

A data prototype is a form of functional or working prototype. The justification for its creation is usually a data migration, data integration or application implementation project and the raw materials used as input are an instance of all the relevant data which exists at the start of the project.
The objectives of data prototyping are to produce:

A set of data cleansing and transformation rules which have been seen to produce data which is all fit for purpose.
A dataset which is the result of those rules being applied to an instance of the relevant raw (source) data.
To achieve this, a data architect uses a graphical interface to interactively develop and execute transformation and cleansing rules using raw data. The resultant data is then evaluated and the rules refined. Beyond the obvious visual checking of the data on-screen by the data architect, the usual evaluation and validation approaches are to use Data profiling software and then to insert the resultant data into a test version of the target application and trial its use.

Scale modeling[edit]

In the field of scale modeling (which includes model railroading, vehicle modeling, airplane modeling, military modeling, etc.), a prototype is the real-world basis or source for a scale model—such as the real EMD GP38-2 locomotive—which is the prototype of Athearn's (among other manufacturers) locomotive model. Technically, any non-living object can serve as a prototype for a model, including structures, equipment, and appliances, and so on, but generally prototypes have come to mean full-size real-world vehicles including automobiles (the prototype 1957 Chevy has spawned many models), military equipment (such as M4 Shermans, a favorite among US Military modelers), railroad equipment, motor trucks, motorcycles, and space-ships (real-world such as Apollo/Saturn Vs, or the ISS). As of 2014, basic rapid prototype machines (such as 3D printers) cost about $2,000, but larger and more precise machines can cost as much as $500,000.[10]

Metrology[edit]
In the science and practice of metrology, a prototype is a human-made object that is used as the standard of measurement of some physical quantity to base all measurement of that physical quantity against. Sometimes this standard object is called an artifact. In the International System of Units (SI), the only prototype remaining in current use is the International Prototype Kilogram, a solid platinum-iridium cylinder kept at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) in Sèvres France (a suburb of Paris) that by definition is the mass of exactly one kilogram. Copies of this prototype are fashioned and issued to many nations to represent the national standard of the kilogram and are periodically compared to the Paris prototype.

Until 1960, the meter was defined by a platinum-iridium prototype bar with two scratch marks on it (that were, by definition, spaced apart by one meter), the International Prototype Metre, and in 1983 the meter was redefined to be the distance in free space covered by light in 1/299,792,458 of a second (thus defining the speed of light to be 299,792,458 meters per second).

It is widely believed that the kilogram prototype standard will be replaced. There are two likely replacements. One is a definition of the kilogram that will define another physical constant (likely either Planck's constant or the elementary charge) to a defined numerical value, thus obviating the need for the prototype and removing the possibility of the prototype (and thus the standard and definition of the kilogram) changing very slightly over the years because of loss or gain of atoms. The other definition is using a system that finds the amount of force needed to counteract the pull of earth's gravity on a one kilogram artifact.[11]

Natural sciences[edit]
In many sciences, from pathology to taxonomy, prototype refers to a disease, species, etc. which sets a good example for the whole category. In Biology, prototype is the ancestral or primitive form of a species or other group; an archetype.[12] For example, the Senegal bichir is regarded as the prototypes of its genus, Polypterus.
