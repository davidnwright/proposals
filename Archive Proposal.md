Curation as Authorship: A Challenge to Narratives of the Archive

The proposed paper contrasts Sydney Padua's *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*, which uses an archive of letters between Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage as a base for its fictions, with more biographic archival memoirs such as a *Maus*, *Persepolis*, and *Fun Home*. Padua's texts deploy archival footnotes that work to consistently interrupt narrative flow, destabilizing overlying fantasy narratives that imagine unrealized futures. Like William Gibson's *Agrippa*, Ann Carson's *Nox*, and Emily Haden's *The Archivist*, Padua's textual interplay, built on  letters, photographs, or other ephemera, create fractures in the reader's sense of narrative coherence and their expectations for the medium of fiction. At the same time, Padua's insertion of her own commentary about her work with the Babbage and Lovelace archive asserts the author's role in the curation of materials presented to the reader--the text is not so much a fiction as a record of the process of fictionalizing or making narrative. By interrogating Padua's curation next to the biographical curation of narratives based on first-person accounts, or personal archives--*Maus*, *Fun Home*, *Nox* which also foreground the process of making narrative--the paper argues that authors are foregrounding the techniques of curation, rather than traditional notions of authorship, by deploying narratives that challenge the apparent stability of the archive. 

I've consulted the narrative is what Sydney Padua seems to suggest in *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* but she still creates a fictional world on top of that... whereas more traditional memoirs of the medium, such as *Maus* and *Persepolis* and *Fun Home* prioritize the actual archive or the "real" story. Well, which is it? How does the duplicity of the archive's role as holder of truth become problematize by fantasy worlds built on top of archives--thinking here of Emily Haden letters in *The Archivist* or in the more tactile versions of *Nox* and *Agrippa*. 

The Pentagon papers is an archive that reveals, in a post-truth era, how do fictionalized representations of the archive offer a space for examining a fluid truth. 

Thinking too of the *Titanic* books and the *World War One* books that feature archival materials for learning. Bringing the archive home--thinking too of *Frank Lloyd Wright* book. 

I suppose the underlying question here is: how do current representations of the archive destabilize the archives ability to remain a space of truth. 


Greive-Carlson, Gary, Ed. *Olson's Prose*. Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars, 2007. Print.

Writing about the prodigious production of the poet Charles Olson, Gary Grieve Carlson notes that "Olson produced texts as a way of sharing his findings and participating in a community of writers and researchers, but that the larger shape of his practice is only  discernible in his total output, which is not a matter of books alone. In his final years, Olson abandoned the book as ultimate horizon and worked instead to produce an archive. Poems and essays, yes, but also notes, notebooks, correspondence, marginalia in books, the books themselves, files of articles, maps, and recordings of readings, lectures, and interviews" (Grieve-Carlson viii). What triggers here is the notion that we are no longer writers. As a culture, we are all curators of our own multi-faceted, multi-media, production. My friend write essays, draws comics, paints watercolours, and blogs. What might we make of this archive going forward? Not that we have not always had numerous modes of cultural output, but with technological advances, we are producing different kinds of archives--everyone is a tv host, everyone a radio jockey, everyone a prodigious texter. And, what of those who are not such things? Do they absent themselves from the cultural conversation? Who owns our archives in an age of cloud storage?

We need to start thinking about the CMS (content management systems) we are presented with--and using--online as types of fill-in-the-blank forms akin to Gitelman's descriptions: " The meaning of documents thus inheres symbolically, materially, and graphically, according to the contexts in which documents make sense as visible and/as material objects. A multitude of forms--some of them literally fill-in-the-blank forms--helped to shape and enable, to define and delimit, the transactions in which they were deployed" (Gitelman 12).

Speaking to how Ereaders enable a collaborative reading of texts, Dennis Tenen notes that in so being,  "The work was preprocessed, in both technical and the social senses of the word, to privlege certain meanings and modes of comprehension" (Tenen 5). It is this move to preprocess that interests me through its connection(s) to the work of archivists who must also preprocess materials. What biases or otherwise does this presupposition suggest or yield? 

Tenen suggests that "Text is irrevocably intertwined with its stratified material contexts" (Tenen 5)

"The word is in the wires" (Dennis Tenen 5)

"Losing sight of the material contexts of knowledge production is politically perilous, because those who own the contexts set the terms of engagement" (Tenen 9). Thinking about this when I think of comparisons between two texts--like Cordell's move with James' "The Real Thing." It is not the writer that owns the context, but often the publisher!

"Devices that 'watch,' 'see,' and 'think' give rise to object-oriented ontology and the Internet of Things. A new generation of objects clamors for participatory intelligence. They claim space in the home, near the hearth. Smart phones, smart lightbulbs, smart thermostats, smart homes, and smart watches enter the networked public sphere in the role of independent agents" (Tenen 10). There's something here about how these devices automatically post things. How they have agency, but perhaps not free will, unless the free will is in the glitch. 

FREE WILL IS IN THE GLITCH

"personal archives might be assuming a new importance in society as the technical means for creating, maintaining, and using documents improve and become more cost-effective, and, as individuals and families seek to preserve their old documents, especially traditional paper forms, as a connection to a past that may seem to be in risk of being swallowed up in the immense digital gadgetry in our Internet Age" (Richard J. Cox vii)

"Personal record keeping raises a remarkable array of issues and concerns about records and their preservation, public or collective memory, the mission of professional records managers and archivists, the nature of the role of the institutional archives, and the function of the individual citizen as their own archivist." (Cox vii)



Panel description: 

Contemporary authors are keeping "things" inside books in order to subvert epistemological circumscription, drawing attention to the distributed networks of people and media that configure knowledge. Avant-garde authors throughout the 20th-/21st- centuries have also turned to the book’s archivability. However, this practice has become increasingly prevalent since the 1980s with changes in the print culture and the proliferation of digital media. Theresa Cha’s Dictee (1982),  Steve Tomasula’s The Book of Portraiture (2006), Mark Z. Danielewski’s Only Revolutions (2006), and Anne Carson’s Nox (2010) are popular examples of multimodal books that are also archives. These books functionalize several semiotic systems and foreground the visual, tactile features of the archives and, as such, are “multimodal.” 

In this panel, we are interested in papers that would consider why and how contemporary authors are transforming the book-object into a site for archiving and the extent to which this practice might be problematizing basic assumptions common to narrative theory, and whether a more interdisciplinary approach, such as one that combines narrative theory with the field of textual and media studies, would benefit our understanding of multimodal books as archives and works of archival fiction.

Thus, we invite scholars of contemporary narrative, literature, and culture to submit (150 to 200-word) abstracts for a fifteen to twenty minute paper presentation on those multimodal fictions, poetry, or comics (1980-present, but preferably 21st century) in which issues of archive play a significant role. 

We seek papers that explore the narratological issues raised when literary texts foreground the motifs, thematics, and topoi of collecting, appraising, or preserving media artifacts, interrogating the material and expressive resources of the book medium, prompting us to think more critically about the ontological similarities and differences between fictional/literary archives and actual archives or databases.

 Likewise, we invite papers that explore the relation of archiving as a cultural practice with the experience of memory and recall in the light of the contemporary multimodal literary texts.

Questions this panel is interested in include but are not limited to:

- In what ways do archived materials impact the narrative experience of fictions and poetry?
- How do archived materials in books lead to the narrativization of non-narrative media, such as photographs and maps?
- How do multimodal archives within books affect the construction of fictional minds and representation of thought in fictional narratives?
- Can multimodality resist dominant modes of representation, potentiating new configurations between material signs and biological subjects?
- Can multimodal books as archives enable us to reimagine “reading” as an embodied, intersubjective performance for political ends?
- How can archived objects in narratives be read and understood with reference to existing frameworks for studying materiality such as Media Archaeology, Thing Theory, or Object Oriented Ontology?
- How do the presence of objects within books impact or revise our understanding of narratological concepts such as point of view, narrative voice, progression, or storyworlds?
