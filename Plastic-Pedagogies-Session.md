**Session Rubric: Mapping / Building / Playing**

Break the session into 3 parts, 25 minutes each, leaving 15 minutes for questions at the end.

**Section 1: Mapping - 25 minutes**

WE NEED:
- PHOTOCOPIES OF LONDON / NYC TUBE / SUBWAY MAP
- BLUE & RED & GREEN FELT PENS (Sharpie size)
- CHART PAPER & MARKERS

We begin the session by suggesting that design thinking in the classroom can be defined as being able to trace routes, represent expectations and assumptions by mapping out goals or, finding alternative paths / representations that we did not see / expect in the first instance. Regardless of discipline, learning is about understanding how knowledge is acquired; mapping can make this process visual and help students to communicate roadblocks and misdirection more explicitly.

The idea here is to figure out what we want by mapping some paths and seeing how our constructions of those paths might inform our encounters. We also want to see how the imposition of rules, whether by our own expectations or by the will of others will affect the desired outcomes or reveal how alternative paths are necessary. 

**Activity I, in groups of 3/4:**

- **Task:**
	- **Using a red pen:** Chart a way through the map to any one "tourist" destination using only the information you have at hand and imagining yourself as someone who cannot speak English (no using the internet, no reading beyond phonic nonsense--you may use yr own knowledge of the locale).
	- **Using a blue pen:** Chart a way through the map to a different "tourist" destination using whatever method you like (use internet to identify routes, the attraction, etc.).
	- **Using a green pen:** Chart a way through the map to "any" destination you think is interesting using one of the above parameters (but not both).
- **Emerging Questions:**
	- How was your initial destination discussed and decide upon? What political machinations occurred in your group (ie: who took charge and why)? How might this exercise be helpful in the classroom?
	- How did the destination shift when the second parameter was added? Did it shift? Why? Why not? How might this exercise be helpful in the classroom?
	- What was the outcome of the Third parameter? How might this exercise be useful in the classroom?
	- What does the map look like entirely? What does this suggest about the complexity of your thinking or the representation of that thinking?
	- Anyone build in an alternate subway line? Why / Why not? 

**Activity II, in groups of 3/4:**

- **Task:** Conceptualize a board game that represents your expectations for this session (past, present, or future).
- **Instructions:** The board game must have a set of rules that set out the following:
	- How does the game resolve? (Note: this doesn't necessarily mean winning or losing, but ending.)
	- How do you move or change direction? (ie: wrong answer means move back? learn something new means move forward? How many spaces (what is the measure of success?)
	- Are there "penalties" associated with movement through the game? Can players lose a turn, e.g.? How are these penalties "earned" and what makes them penalties, conceptually? (Eg, if the player's piece must be moved to another spot on the board, what makes this "bad"?)
	- And, the game instructions must explain why the board looks like it does. 
- **Emerging Questions:** 
	- So why does the board look like it does? How does this inform how you are approaching the workshop (what set ideologies / outcomes / perspectives / topics / expectations are already in this room?
	- What is the nature of the game's resolution? Why might this be important when we think about open classroom practice?
	- What political actions are implicated in the movements of the game? What expectations, ideologies, knowledge, skills, assumptions, AUDIENCES, are embedded in those movements or the forces that enact the movements?

**Section 2: Prototyping** - 25 minutes**

WE NEED:
- HANDOUTS OF AIRLINE SEATBACK INFORMATION SHEET

In this section, we are thinking about how prototyping serves to provide insight into how systems operate (and we might think of an essay as a system for rhetorical argument / a Math equation as a system for representing objects and their numbers, etc.) by making / exploring working systems and dreaming up new prototypes.

The idea here is to move away from the theoretical discussion into a deployment of the system itself. Take home exercise example here would be making students build a paper airplane then asking them to pass them around and then asking them to write the instructions for building one the one the hold in their hands (not the one they built). Then, pass the instructions around and see how closely they resemble the prototype. 

What we want to put forward in the classroom is a process where students can evaluate their own systems of learning, their own systems for formal writing / tests, in order build a better formal presentation of the product. Being able to evaluate systems of learning also empowers students to ask for help and improve, leapfrogging the inherent problem of students not having the vocabulary to describe their struggles with the assigned outcome. ("I don't know how to write a good essay" is less useful than "I am having difficulty making argument X in relation to Y.")

In this instance, we are also thinking about prototyping as a form of repair, not of invention. The goal is to prototype improvements to convention not simply invent workarounds. 

**Activity III, in groups of 3/4:**

- **Task:**
	- Reduce the number of frame sequences in the seat-back information sheet to three (for ONE of the actions).
- **Instructions:**
	- Most of the instructions feature a sequence of between 5 and 9 frames to convey the actions needed to survive in an airline event. Try to pair things down so that there are only three frames per sequence. You can fill the frames as much as you like. Be daring, follow your heart. 
- **Emerging Questions:**
	- What assumptions are embedded in the original sequences that emerged when they were edited? How might this be useful practice for a classroom? (Anyone in Math? English? Where we tend to start with ideals).
	- Did you invent, or edit? Why?
	- What assumptions about the audience / comprehension-level / critical thinking skills did your group bring to this activity? Were those recognizable in the original instance?

**Activity IV, in groups of 3/4:**
- **Task:** 
	- Apply the outcomes from the above activity to create a 3 sequence direction for being successful in your classroom or in your role at the institution (a training card per se).
- **Emerging Questions:**
	- How did audience frame what you were building?
	- How many of the sequences actually correspond to general concerns rather than your specific concerns (in other words, how much do I need to know about Higher Ed to interpret the meaning behind the sequence?)
	- How does your inability to or confidence in drawing, illustrating inform how you complete this task? Is there any "equality"? 
	- Who got left out? Who won't understand your icons? Why?

**Section 3: Playing - 25 minutes**

WE NEED
- DIGITAL DEVICES (MIN 1 PER GROUP, GROUP ACCORDINGLY)

When we bring technological tools to bear on the practices illustrated above, we might be able to stretch things. Play is different than a game. Play has no formal rules, is open to all (usually outside linguistic, racial, gendered boundaries), has no beginning or end beyond the impetus of the individuals in the sandbox. Play can also be extended to other forms of life--animals, birds, trees all might be called "playful" as we engage with them.

In a technological sense, play can often demand an existing knowledge base than not all students have access to. We're interested in how relatively entry-level Web 2.0 tools can facilitate play for students. Any of these exercises could be "levelled up" for a more tech-ready audience (eg. creating, instead of curating, a gif collection).

**Activity V**
- **Task:**
	- Segueing from the above, curate a collection of GIFs that, when taken together, tell a narrative of the student experience of technological barriers to learning. 
- **Instructions:**
	- Use any online GIF repository (giphy, google image search, etc) to collect 4-5 (or more! Or less! It’s play!) GIFs.
	- Assemble them in some kind of narrative order with explanatory captions (eg. "My reaction when [MRW] the google doc crashes and it didn't save.").
	- You can post these as a series of tweets (#plasticpedagogies) or post them to an existing webspace and tweet out the link (#plasticpedagogies).
- **Emerging Questions:**
	- From whose perspective did you actually approach this task? How do you know? 
	- How does your expression of affect change when you mediate it through the GIF? (eg. Is it more extreme, more measured, more tempered by humour, etc.)
	- What insights does this offer in terms of student feedback?
	- Do those GIFs represent something different from your classroom or institutional strategy?
	

**Activity VI** 
- **Task:**
	- Make an anonymized facebook profile of your most frustrated student, faculty member, team member, or employee: someone who works with you in some capacity of EdTech and is experiencing frustration.
- **Instructions:**
	- Use Facebook (or another social media platform of your preference) to create a profile. Give the person an identity, but do not use any identifying characteristics -- the goal here is your learning, not their humiliation.
	- Make several posts (new content, shared links, or something else entirely) that reflect the user’s experience in your tech world. Try to address areas of concern, frustration, lack of engagement, etc.
	- Try to reflect the process of learning this person is attempting to undergo.
- **Emerging Questions:**
	- To what extent does this exercise let you think through the experience of this person? Have you been able to identify key / significant stumbling blocks?
	- What does this profile tell us about our classroom-based practice?
